# AI-level-designer
Currently making a game that designs its own levels for a 2D platformer.

Make sure you have Unity installed from https://unity3d.com/ before you use this project.  
We use the free version for this project, and it comes with its own version of Visual Studio.

From the <>Code tab of this repo, click "Clone or Download" and you may either:
  1) copy and paste "git clone xxx" into a terminal that understands Git and hit Enter.
  2) select the "Download Zip" button and extract the project to a folder in your computer where you can find it.

Double click into that folder and double click the "Assets" folder inside it.

From the "Assets" folder, double click "self-designed-level", a Unity scene file, 
to open the game and hit the play button at the top of the screen.

The project accepts png pictures to run.  The pictures you specify can come from anywhere in your hard drive.  
For reference, the player controlled character is 50 pixels wide and 80 pixels tall.  

During the level itself, use WSAD to move the character and 1-5 to change between character modes.  Have fun! :)
